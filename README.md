# Dice Game (2 players)

I made this game with html, css and javascript to remember some DOM functionalities.
The goal is to reach 100 points rolling the dice.
If the outcome is 1, the next player rolls the dice, otherwise, you accumulate the points you get while rolling it. If you prefer to stop rolling the dice and add your current points to your counter you can click on the 'hold' button.
